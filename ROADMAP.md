# Roadmap

Desired / needed changes

- Add playwright tests for local development
- Fix some of the incorrect colour scheme issue with black text
- Update the time screen with better updates to the simple and detailed workout sequence. Like include visual markers of the rests too? The detailed workout sequence should grey out the complete parts.
- In the workout setup, hovering over a workout name should provide a tooltip of the cueing to get an idea of what an exercise is if it is not obvious from the name.
- Add protected routes to lock the app behind user login
- Add routes per page so that we can share predefined URLs that configure the page which make it easier for people to bookmark.
- Add the concept of "Workout Plans". 
    - Which is a list of workout configs 
    - and we could jump to any workout in that array of workouts 
    - then layer the workout config to a set of dates and times where each datetime could be a calednar entry with the direct link to that workout in the series.
